# Kotlin Coroutines Final Exercise

For this exercise we are generating a list of potential students.

In the [PotentialStudentService](src/main/kotlin/com/openvalue/kotlin/coroutines/demo/services/PotentialStudentService.kt) implement the only function that is in there.
Use the [clients](src/main/kotlin/com/openvalue/kotlin/coroutines/demo/clients) and [validator](src/main/kotlin/com/openvalue/kotlin/coroutines/demo/validators) for this. Do the validation as efficient as possible.
